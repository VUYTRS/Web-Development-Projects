# Tribute Webpage

A tribute website essentially serves as a biography of a person we respect. In this article, we'll use HTML and CSS to build a memorial webpage. At the bottom of the title, we'll add a picture to the middle and make a box around it. We shall list some of his accomplishments and biographical information inside that box. To write the details, we will utilise the div and p tags, and the img tag for the image. The design will then be aligned and enhanced using CSS.
