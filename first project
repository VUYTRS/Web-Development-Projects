Visualizing and forecasting stocks using Dash
About the project: For those new to Python and data science, this project is a fantastic place to start, and for those who have used Python and Machine Learning in the past, it serves as a helpful recap. Feel free to investigate any firm (whose stock code is available) for whom this web application can be used.

How to do it: If youâ€™re interested in the stock market, this project will make it simple for you to visualize stock data. This strong project just uses Python as a programming language. Web development is also included in this intermediate project.
